An instrument sales website, using Django (python and db), HTML and Bootstrap
This is a model site, focused in back-end, that i created to show my habilities with data-base, python, django, HTML, Bootstrap and JS(Which are the technologies used in the web-site).
I worked in this project entirely by myself, and the idea came to show my skills in a web devolop enviroment, using django framework to manipulate database, and bootstrap for front-end.
To run it, download the folder, and in the therminal, in the folder directory write python3 manage.py runserver. After this, copy the adress it passes and in the end of it, write "/products".
Exemple: http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/
After it, paste in the URL bar and press search.
